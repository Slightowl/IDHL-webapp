# IDHL In House Developer Test

This test should be **no more than 1 hour**. Good luck!

Est time took - 3hr ~ o_o

Thoughts -
I think the concepts are *just* about there, had a bit of issue implementing it.
Think with a few more hours could get it done but I don't want to go too much over
the recommneded time allowance. Will defintely revist this and these concepts. Happy
to discuss how I got.
